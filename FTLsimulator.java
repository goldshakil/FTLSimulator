-  Company: VLDB Lab @ Sungkyunkwan University

- Programmer/Developer: Dahab Muhammad Shakeel

- Main Purpose: 1) Implementing the Greedy FTL
                2) Creating an optimal garbage collector provided the future references

- Details:     1) Write Unit is Page (Rgardless of Page's size)
               2) Each Block has 4 Pages
               3) The Simulator does OS job and sends Logical addresses
               4) FTL translates the Logical to Physical Addresses Accordingly
               5) FTL does the garbage collection
               6) Addresses are read from a text file called "Addresses.txt"
               7)
